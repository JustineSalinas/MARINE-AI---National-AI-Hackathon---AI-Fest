Every entry carries its licence and source URL. `data/download.py` refuses to

true after the fourth late-night dataset addition.

    # FEMTO / PRONOSTIA is named in the technical profile but is NOT used here.
    # Two reasons, recorded so the omission is a decision rather than an oversight:
    #
    #   1. Its NASA PCoE download key could not be resolved on 2026-07-22. The
    #      data.nasa.gov entry 404s and the phm-datasets S3 bucket denies listing.
    #      We do not cite a source we could not download.
    #
    #   2. More fundamentally, it would not have helped. FEMTO is bench-rig bearing
    #      vibration sampled at 25.6 kHz. Bearing defect signatures live in the
    #      kilohertz band. The retrofit IMU logs at ~1 Hz alongside the other
    #      electro-mechanical channels, which is three to four orders of magnitude
    #      too slow to resolve them. Pretraining on FEMTO and applying it to a 1 Hz
    #      IMU stream would imply a diagnostic capability the sensor cannot deliver.
    #
    # What the IMU is genuinely good for at 1 Hz -- sustained vibration energy
    # trending upward, shock events, changes in mounting rigidity -- is learned
    # from the vessel's own baseline instead. See docs/DEVIATIONS.md.
