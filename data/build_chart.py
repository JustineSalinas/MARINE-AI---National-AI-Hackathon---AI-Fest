"""Extract the demo route's chart geometry from Natural Earth.

    python -m data.build_chart

Writes `apps/bridge/public/chart.json`: coastline polylines for the
Iloilo Strait, in normalised chart coordinates, plus the geographic bounds so
the display can convert between screen position and real latitude/longitude.

**Why this exists.** The prototype simulator used a screenshot of a web map as
its chart background. The submission is graded on "use only licensed or public
datasets", and a screenshot of someone else's basemap is neither licensed nor
attributable. Natural Earth is public domain, already declared in
`data/registry.py`, and renders as a drawn nautical chart rather than a tile
basemap -- no API key, no quota, nothing to fail on stage.

Natural Earth 10m is a global dataset at roughly 1:10,000,000. That is the right
scale for showing where a route runs and the wrong scale for navigation, and the
distinction is recorded in the output so it cannot be quietly forgotten: the
depth constraint comes from bathymetry, never from this outline.
