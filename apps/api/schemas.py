"""Wire models for the advisory API.

Split from `main.py` so the request/response shape is readable on its own and so
`packages/contracts/export_schema.py` can emit TypeScript for it alongside the
shared contracts.

Note the division of labour. `packages/contracts` holds models that cross module
boundaries inside the system -- telemetry, recommendations, bridge state -- and
is the single source of truth for those. The models here are HTTP-level: what a
client must send, and the extra diagnostic detail the simulator wants but the
bridge display does not. `SpeedRecommendation` is imported, never redefined.
