"""AI Predictive Maintenance output contract.

This model enforces the technical profile's cold-start fairness commitment as a
*validation rule*, not a convention. A Phase 1 unit -- any vessel with less than
roughly 24 months of labelled maintenance history -- physically cannot emit a
component name or a replacement date through this contract. The validator
rejects it.

The reason it is a validator and not a code review guideline: the failure mode
being guarded against is a well-meaning UI change, three days before a demo,
that surfaces a Phase 2 field because it happened to be non-null. Making it
unrepresentable is cheaper than remembering.
