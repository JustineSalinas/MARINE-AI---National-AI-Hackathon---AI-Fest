"""AI Route Optimization output contract.

The route is scored by the *same* fuel model that drives Speed Optimization.
That shared cost basis is the strongest architectural claim in the technical
profile, so `predicted_burn_l` on this model and `predicted_burn_lph` on
`SpeedRecommendation` must both come from `services/speed/fuel.py`, costed
through `services/speed/optimizer.py`. An integration test asserts they agree.
